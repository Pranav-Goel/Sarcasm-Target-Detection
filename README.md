# Sarcasm-Target-Detection
A new, manually labeled dataset for the novel task of Sarcasm Target Identification.

There are two files - snippets.xlsx (224 book snippets) and tweets.xslx (506 tweets)

In both the files, each unit is a sarcastic text (snippet or tweet) annotated for the sarcasm target - the subset of words in the text which indicate the entity or the situation being ridiculed. In case the target is not found within the text, a fallback label of 'Outside' is expected.

The tweets file will be updated soon with the Tweet IDs and corresponding labels.
